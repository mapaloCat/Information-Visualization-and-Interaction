#### **What is Principal Component Analysis?**
***


[**_Principal Components Analysis_** ](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/principal-components-analysis/)(PCA) is the most popular dimensionality reduction technique to date. It allows us to take an n-dimensional feature-space and reduce it to a k-dimensional feature-space while maintaining as much information from the original dataset as possible in the reduced dataset. Specifically, PCA will create a new feature-space that aims to capture as much variance as possible in the original dataset.

The next graphs and displays (numerated) are the result of applying a PCA to Europe dataset.
