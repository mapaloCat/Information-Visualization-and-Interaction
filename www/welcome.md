## About the app
This Shiny application offers a friendly interface to users that want to explore and analyse Europe Stats dataset. The application includes various features that are divided into the following tabs:  

*  **Explore Europe Stats Dataset**: This tab allows the user to explore the different variables of the dataset and study how those variables are related to each other. It is divided into two subtabs:
 * **Dataset**: The dataset is presented in the form of a table.
 * **Data exploration**: This tab includes several exploratory graphs that can be studied to understand the nature of the dataset and the correlation between the different atttributes.
 
* **Data analysis**: This tab is dedicated to data analysis tasks. First, it comes with a brief explanation about what PCA is, alongside different visualization graphs to give a better understanding of the effects of applying PCA to Europe Stats dataset. PCA is followed by the option to perform two different clustering algorithms: Hierrachical clustering and Kmeans. In addition to multiple visualization graphs that depict the results of clustering, a Silhoutte graph is present to validate the peformance of the applied clustering algorithm.
 

## About the dataset
The Europe Stats Dataset contains statistics of several european countries and it can be effectively analyzed by means of hierarchical clustering. It includes the following variables:  

* **Country**:(char) A list of 28 european countries.
