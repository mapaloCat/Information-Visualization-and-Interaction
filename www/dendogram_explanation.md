#### **What is a dendogram?**
****
A [dendrogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrogram) is a diagram representing a tree. This diagrammatic representation is frequently used in different contexts:

 * In [hierarchical clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering), it illustrates the arrangement of the clusters produced by the corresponding analyses.
 * In computational biology, it shows the clustering of genes or samples, sometimes in the margins of heatmaps.
 * In phylogenetics, it displays the evolutionary relationships among various biological taxa. In this case, the dendrogram is also called phylogenetic tree.
