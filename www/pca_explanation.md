#### **How to interpret a PCA**
***

In order to choose the new k-dimension feature space we need to be comfortable with the percentage of information that we are going to keep and the percentage we are going to lose. Graphs **2**, **3** and **4** represent this information in various ways. This will allow you to decide the number of dimensions or components you want to keep for later analysis like clustering for example.


Graphs **5** and **6** have the purpose of let you understand how each component of the PCA summarize the information of variance of the dataset. This way you can get a more global and deeper understanding of the variance explained in the new reduce k-dimension feature space that you are choosing for further analysis of the dataset. 

**We encourage you to try different combinations thanks to the interactive graphs!!!.**
