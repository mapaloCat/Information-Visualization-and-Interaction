#### **How to interpret a PCA**
***

In order to choose the new k-dimension feature space we need to know the percentage of information that we are going to keep and the percentage we are going to lose. The scree plot, the variance graph and the barplot of the variables contribution illustrate this information in various ways. This allows the user to decide the number of dimensions or components to keep for later analysis.


The dedicated graphs to the accumulative variance explained by components and the percentage of variance explained by each component, show how each component of the PCA summarize the information of variance of the dataset. This way the user gets a global and deeper understanding of the variance explained in the new reduce k-dimension feature space that is going to be used for further analysis of the dataset. 

**We encourage you to try different combinations thanks to the interactive graphs!**
