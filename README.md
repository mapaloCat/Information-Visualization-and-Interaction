# Information-Visualization-and-Interaction
There is a lack of reliable information for European citizens on EE stats. We have designed and developed a Shiny application that can be used to visualize economic, wellbeing, military and technology aspects across countries. The application incorporates interactive maps, heatmaps, bar charts, radar charts, lolliplot graphs, scatterplots, and dendrograms to visualize insights. It was found
that on these attributes there are multiple highlighted variations, but the clearest difference is between western and eastern Europe.

The application is deployed online in the following link: https://panagiotismichalopoulos.shinyapps.io/Information-Visualization-and-Interaction/

The data is gathered from the CIA World Factbook.
