# Information-Visualization-and-Interaction
There is a lack of reliable information for European citizens on EE stats. We have developed a Shiny application designed to visualize economic, wellbeing, military, and technology aspects across European countries. The application incorporates interactive maps, heatmaps, bar charts, radar charts, lolliplots, scatterplots, and dendrograms to visualize insights. By studying the graphs and attributes, the user inspects multiple disparities among the European countries, where the most obvious lies in the differences between the east and the west.

The application is deployed online in the following link: https://panagiotismichalopoulos.shinyapps.io/Information-Visualization-and-Interaction/

The data is gathered from the CIA World Factbook.
