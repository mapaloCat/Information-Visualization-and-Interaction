# Information-Visualization-and-Interaction
There is a lack of reliable information for European citizens. We have developed a Shiny application that can be used
to compare countries with each other based on economic, wellbeing, military and technology aspects. The application incorporates
interactive maps, heatmaps, bar charts, radar charts, lolliplot graphs, scatterplots, and dendrograms to visualize insights. It was found
that on these attributes there are many differences, but the clearest difference is between west and east Europe.

The application is deployed and can be found online in the following link: https://panagiotismichalopoulos.shinyapps.io/Information-Visualization-and-Interaction/

The data is gathered from the CIA world Factbook.
